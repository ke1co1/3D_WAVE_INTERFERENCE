# 3D Wave Interference Sphere

A 3D visualization of wave interference on a sphere using p5.js and p5.easycam. This project allows you to control various parameters of the wave interference pattern through a set of sliders, providing an interactive and visually appealing representation.

## Project Description

This project demonstrates wave interference on a 3D sphere. The user can control the amplitude, frequency, and phase of the waves along the X and Y axes, as well as the rotation speed, zoom level, and time speed of the animation. The visualization is created using the p5.js library for rendering and p5.easycam for interactive camera control.

## Features

- Control X and Y amplitude, frequency, and phase.
- Adjust time speed and spin speed.
- Zoom in and out using a slider and mouse wheel.
- Toggle visibility of controls.

## Live Demo

You can view the live demo of this project on GitHub Pages: [3D Wave Interference Sphere](https://ke1co1.github.io/3D-Wave-Interference-Sphere/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need to have:

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kelcol/3D-Wave-Interference-Sphere.git
   cd 3D-Wave-Interference-Sphere

2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.


### Usage

1. Open the project in your web browser.
2. Click the "Controls" button to toggle the visibility of the control sliders.
3. Adjust the sliders to change the wave interference parameters and see the effects in real-time.
   
    X-Amplitude: Controls the amplitude of the wave along the X-axis.
    X-Frequency: Controls the frequency of the wave along the X-axis.
    X-Phase: Controls the phase shift of the wave along the X-axis.
    Y-Amplitude: Controls the amplitude of the wave along the Y-axis.
    Y-Frequency: Controls the frequency of the wave along the Y-axis.
    Y-Phase: Controls the phase shift of the wave along the Y-axis.
    Time Speed: Controls the speed of the animation.
    Spin Speed: Controls the rotation speed of the sphere.
    Zoom Level: Controls the zoom level of the view.
